- A more sophisticated version of the MCP was published in 1958 by Rosenblatt, called the perceptron. 6 The perceptron, illustrated in (Fig. 3) processed non-Boolean inputs

- In 1968, Minsky and Papert 11 demonstrated the limitations of the perceptron by identifying that a Boolean function such as the XOR function that could not be modeled using a perceptron with 2 inputs and without significant user handling.

- The second significant publication that played a major role in initiating the first AI winter was by Lighthill 12 in 1973, providing an overview of the hype in the field and emphasis on the very small progress in the field.

- However, by the mid 1980s, it was recognized that, although expert systems were capable of performing very specific tasks, these models lacked common sense, could not be used to perform more complex tasks, and were not generalizable.

- The capabilities of AI paired with sufficient computational power was demonstrated in 1997 when IBM developed the chess playing supercomputer Deep Blue. Deep Blue defeated the chess champion Kasparov, which led to many publications and documentary films that attracted the public’s attention to the field once again
