- MYCIN’s ontology includes bacteria, symptoms, tests, possible sites of infection, antibiotics and treatments. Doctors, hospitals, illness and death are absent. Even patients are not really part of the ontology, although MYCIN asks for many facts about the speciﬁc patient. This is because patients aren’t values of variables, and MYCIN never compares the infections of two diﬀerent patients

- Moreover, MYCIN cannot answer a question about a hypothetical treatment, e.g.“What will happen if I give this patient penicillin?” or even “What bad things might happen if I give this patient penicillin?”.
