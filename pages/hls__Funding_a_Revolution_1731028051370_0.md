- Many corporations committed substantial capital and human resources to the development of expert systems, and many reported substantial returns on these investments.

- Others found that, as AI pioneer McCarthy (1990) had argued, these expert systems were extremely “brittle” in that a small development in knowledge or change in practice rendered such programs obsolete or too narrow to use

- In one study of AI (Office of Technology Assessment, 1985), expert systems were singled out as evidence of “the first real commercial products of about 25 years of AI research” but were also criticized for “several serious weaknesses” that demanded“fundamental breakthroughs” to overcome. But expert systems represented a failure to meet expectations as much as a failure of technology. They provided valuable help for users who understand the limitations of a system that embodied narrow domains of knowledge. One of the biggest problems with expert systems was the term itself, which implied a certain level of capability; a number of users started calling them knowledge-based systems to refer to the technology instead of the goal.

- One of Trilogy’s founders (a Stanford University graduate) learned about the expert system that Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) had developed for Digital Equipment Corporation to configure its VAX computers (XCON).4 Basing their work in part on the systems that had emerged from DENDRAL and MYCIN and what they learned about XCON, Trilogy’s founders also used constraintbased equations and object-oriented programming methods, derived in part from AI research.
