- # Glossário

		- When you say that something differs from another thing "epistemologically," you are referring to a difference in the way knowledge about those things is acquired, justified, or understood. Epistemology is the branch of philosophy concerned with the nature and scope of knowledge, including how knowledge is obtained and what constitutes as knowledge.
		  
		  For example:
		- **Sources of Knowledge:** If two concepts differ epistemologically, it could mean that the knowledge about them comes from different sources. One might be known through empirical observation (science), while the other might be known through rational deduction (mathematics).
		- **Justification of Beliefs:** It could also mean that the justification for beliefs about these things is different. One might be justified through sensory experience, whereas another might be justified through logical reasoning.
		- **Types of Knowledge:** Additionally, it might refer to the type of knowledge. One might be a priori (known independently of experience), and the other a posteriori (known through experience).
		  
		  In essence, an epistemological difference highlights a distinction in how we come to understand, justify, or know one thing compared to another.
