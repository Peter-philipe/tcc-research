- One of the largest and long-standing difficulties in designing a pattern-recognizing machine has been the problem how to cope with the shift in position and the distortion in shape of the input patterns.

- In the extended hierarchy model, the cells in the highest stage are supposed to respond only to specific stimulus patterns without affected by the position or the size of the stimuli.

- Fig. 5. For instance, S-plane with k 1 = 1 in layer Us1 consists of a two-dimensional array of S-cells which extract A-shaped features. Since the stimulus pattern"A" contains A-shaped feature at the top, an S-cell near the top of this S-plane yields a large output as shown in the enlarged illustration in the lower part of Fig. 5
