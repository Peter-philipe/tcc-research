- In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the “neuron doctrine” speciﬁed that living cells called “neurons” together with their interconnections were fundamental to what the brain does. One of the people responsible for this suggestion was the Spanish neuroanatomist Santiago Ram´on y Cajal(1852–1934). Cajal (Fig. 2.5) and Camillo Golgi won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1906 for their work on the structure of the nervous system

- In 1943, the American neurophysiologist Warren McCulloch (1899–1969; Fig. 2.7) and logician Walter Pitts (1923–1969) claimed that the neuron was, in essence, a “logic unit.”

- Hebb also postulated that groups of neurons that tend to ﬁre together formed what he called cell assemblies. Hebb thought that the phenomenon of“ﬁring together” tended to persist in the brain and was the brain’s way of representing the perceptual event that led to a cell-assembly’s formation. Hebb said that “thinking” was the sequential activation of sets of cell assemblies

- Rosenblatt deﬁned several types of perceptrons. He called the one shown in the diagram a “series-coupled, four-layer perceptron.” (Rosenblatt counted the inputs as the ﬁrst layer.) It was termed “series-coupled” because the output of each neural element fed forward to neural elements in a subsequent layer.

- We proposed to begin work on this problem by developing an environment in which an apprentice repair person would be given advice about how to take apart and reassemble a small air compressor.1 The advice would be generated (as needed by the apprentice) by a planning and execution system that would give suggestions about what to do next
